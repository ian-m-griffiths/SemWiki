# SemWiki


## Note

This project is a demonstration.  Created through human-AI collaboration with the human providing architectural guidance.

**A Semantic Wiki with Dual-Endian Architecture**

Write naturally. Organize automatically. Search intelligently.

SemWiki is designed for collaborative human and AI knowledge management, featuring associative memory, typed relationships, and automatic organization.

## The Humans Note
It is part of an idea on how to self-organize knowledge from an emergent property of LLMs, using "is_a" typed links in a wiki format. An LLM will create an ontology backwards to the abstract class; when disambiguating word senses, they have ontologies.

In reverse, this forms a depth of search specificity, which then will link to related articles.

The simple need to create a type for a link implies a page, and creates a stub on processing.

The interesting part is that the simple creation of documents with typed links creates an ontology, so information structure emerges from descriptions, classification grows from ontological links, a graph grows, and a search graph's specificity is the inverse of the ontology graph by depth. This emergent graph can be used for classification, disambiguation, search, and ontology.

This is effectively a prototype idea for another project, but I felt it may be useful enough on its own as an idea for someone else.

The AI wrote pretty much everything else besides this note.

## The Problem

Traditional wikis force you to choose between:
- **Folders** (rigid organization that breaks when knowledge evolves)
- **Tags** (flat structure that doesn't show relationships)
- **Links** (manual maintenance, broken references)

## The Solution: Dual-Endian Architecture

SemWiki uses complementary approaches simultaneously:
- Typed links for hierarchical and relational organization
- Classification-endian (least specific first) for ontology
- Search-endian (most specific first) for discovery
- Built-in error detection to manage link integrity

### Wiki Link Style

```markdown
[[bank/financial]]{is_a: institution/financial}
[[bank/geology]]{is_a: geological/formation}
```

**Typed links** enable both hierarchical and relational organization.

### Search-endian (Most Specific First)

```
bank/
├── financial/
│   └── institution/
│       └── organization/
│           └── entity/
└── formation/
    └── geological/
```

Search finds the most specific match first, then traverses up the hierarchy.

### Classification-endian (Least Specific First)

```
concepts/
├── institution/
│   └── financial/
│       └── bank.md
└── geological/
    └── formation/
        └── bank.md
```

Files organize from general categories to specific instances.

### Error Management

Built-in diagnostics detect and report issues:

```bash
./semwiki.py check
./semwiki.py check --report  # Generate AI-friendly error report
```

**Same word, different order, automatically organized.**

## Key Features

🧠 **Automatic Ontology** - Files organize based on `is_a` relationships  
🔍 **Sense Disambiguation** - `bank/financial` vs `bank/geology`  
🌳 **Hierarchical Search** - Results ranked by specificity, truncated at search term  
🔄 **Bidirectional Relations** - `part_of` ↔ `has_part` auto-generated  
⚠️ **Circular Detection** - Prevents ontology loops  
👪 **Multi-Parent Support** - Concepts belong to multiple hierarchies  
📝 **Staged Changes** - Preview before committing  
🔧 **Error Diagnostics** - Built-in checks with AI-friendly reports  

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semwiki.git
cd semwiki
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create Your First Concept

```markdown
<!-- examples/concepts/institution/financial/bank.md -->
# Bank (Financial)

A financial institution that accepts deposits.

[[bank/financial]]{is_a: institution/financial}
```

### 3. Build the Knowledge Graph

```bash
./semwiki.py parse examples/concepts
```

Output:
```
📁 Processing 5 files...
📄 STAGED: Create concepts/institution/financial/bank.md
📄 STAGED: Create concepts/geological/formation/bank.md
✅ Graph: 5 nodes, 8 edges
```

### 4. Search

```bash
./semwiki.py search "bank" --hierarchy
```

Output:
```
🔍 Search: 'bank'

  #1 institution/financial/bank
     └── institution/financial
         └── institution

  #2 geological/formation/bank
     └── geological/formation
         └── geological
```

## How It Works

### The Key Mechanism: `is_a` Relationships

When you write:
```markdown
[[bank/financial]]{is_a: institution/financial}
```

SemWiki:
1. Parses the `is_a` relationship
2. Creates file: `concepts/institution/financial/bank.md`
3. Builds graph edge: `bank/financial --is_a--> institution/financial`
4. Generates inverse: `institution/financial --has_instance--> bank/financial`
5. Updates taxonomy index for fast search

### Multi-Parent Example

```markdown
[[credit_union]]{is_a: [institution/financial, cooperative/business]}
```

Creates:
- Primary: `concepts/institution/financial/credit_union.md`
- Alias: `concepts/cooperative/business/credit_union.md`

### Search Truncation

Search "bank" returns:
- ✅ `institution/financial/bank` (contains "bank")
- ✅ `geological/formation/bank` (contains "bank")
- ❌ `institution/financial/bank/CommBank` (more specific, excluded)
- ❌ `organization/institution` (doesn't contain "bank")

**Clean disambiguation without overwhelming detail.**

## Error Diagnostics

SemWiki includes built-in diagnostics to catch issues:

```bash
# Check for errors
./semwiki.py check

# Generate AI-friendly error report
./semwiki.py check --report
```

**Detects:**
- Missing references (broken links)
- Circular is_a relationships
- Incomplete hierarchies (missing parents)
- Classification mismatches
- Orphaned files
- Missing bidirectional relations

**AI Integration:** The `--report` flag generates `semwiki_errors.json` with structured error data for automated fixing.
